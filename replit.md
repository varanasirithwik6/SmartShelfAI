# SmartShelfAI - Food Waste Prediction System

## Overview

SmartShelfAI is a Streamlit-based web application that uses machine learning to predict food waste percentages for various fruits. The system helps optimize storage conditions and reduce spoilage by analyzing factors like fruit type, quantity, storage duration, temperature, and humidity. The application provides an intuitive interface for predictions, data analysis, model training, and cost analysis.

## User Preferences
